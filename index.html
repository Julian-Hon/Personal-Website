            <strong>About Me</strong>
            <p>Hi! My name is Julian Hon. I'm a junior at Texas A&M studying computer science. I'm an aspiring full stack developer, I'm also interested in the field of cybersecurity and networking. My most recent experience is an IT internship that I did with Westerman and associates. At this internship I got hands-on experience with technical helpdesk, cisco meraki dashboard/devices, and firewall configuration. With my new technical helpdesk experience I gained valuable customer service and communication skills. This past summer I also received my Comptia Security+ certification which gave me a foundation in network security, security protocol, firewall security, and policy. In my free time I like to create software projects,  I find these cool because of their usability. Being able to create something that is useful is a great feeling. In the past I worked as a project manager for Aggie Coding Club where I created an AI recipe application that lets users take pictures of their pantries and spits out recipes that they can make. For a more personal project I've been working on a league of legends companion application. What it does is it lets people see their stats and how well they are performing in their games from any device. Outside of my career, I'm a very music oriented person. I'm always listening and playing music in my downtime. Video games also have played a large role in who I am. I like video games that are a direct 1v1 competitive format, usually online card games. When winning them it feels like my brain is what sets us apart. Lastly, I enjoy swimming and badminton. I used to do competitive swimming from elementary through high school and chased the high of beating my previous records. When it comes to badminton its fun to just rally the birdie as we chat about random things.</p>
